Hey everybody !

I'm Sarah, and I'm a 16 years old student in languages and litterature (even if I hate litterature). High-school's not for me (too boring I would say), and that's why I want to start university as soon as possible !
I went to Nantes to buy some mangas with friends, and it was quite fun.
